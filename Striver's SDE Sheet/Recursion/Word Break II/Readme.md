You are supposed to construct and return all possible sentences after adding spaces in the originally given string ‘S’, such that each word in a sentence exists in the given dictionary.</h4>

<h4 id="note">Note :</h4>

<pre><code>The same word in the dictionary can be used multiple times to make sentences.
Assume that the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
</code></pre>

<h4 id="input-format">Input format :</h4>

<pre><code>The first line contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases. 

Then the 'T' test cases follow.

The first line contains an integer value ‘K’ which denotes the size of the dictionary.

The second line contains ‘K’ non-empty, space separated strings denoting the words of the dictionary.

The third line contains a non-empty string ‘S’.
</code></pre>

<h4 id="output-format">Output format :</h4>

<pre><code>For each test case, print each possible sentence after adding spaces, in different lines.

The output of each test case is printed in a separate line. 
</code></pre>

<h5 id="note">Note :</h5>

<pre><code>1. You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
2. The order in which the output sentences are returned does not matter.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraints">Constraints :</h5>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10
1 &lt;= K &lt;= 100
1 &lt;= | word | &lt;= 16
1 &lt;= | S | &lt;= 13

where |word| is the length of each word in the dictionary and |S| is the length of the string S.
