<div class="p-html-content p-statement"><div class="p-html-content__container"><p>You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.</p>

<p>Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.</p>

<p>Return A and B.</p>

<p><em>Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?</em></p>

<p><em>Note that in your output A should precede B.</em></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Input:[3 1 2 5 3] 

Output:[3, 4] 

A = 3, B = 4
</code></pre>
</div>
